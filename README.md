## Work & Projects  
### *Master Thesis - Evaluation & Monitoring of RAG for Enterprise Applications* (Grade: 1.3 | Duration: 6 months) 
LLMs excel in natural language understanding but often generate inaccurate responses. RAG enhances factual correctness by integrating retrieved knowledge. This study examines evaluation methodologies for RAG, incorporating traditional retrieval metrics (MRR, NDCG, Hit Rate) and generative assessment (reference-based & reference-free metrics). The research highlights how specialized fine-tuned models can serve as reliable evaluation tools, offering practical insights for optimizing enterprise RAG implementations.
