## Work & Projects
### *Research Associate in AI & Sustainability at Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany* (05/2025 ‚Äì Current)
- Developing AI-driven methodologies using NLP & HCI for sustainability reporting.


### *Master Thesis - Evaluating and Monitoring Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Enhanced Performance in Commercial Applications* (Grade: 1.3 | Duration: 6 months) 
- In this thesis work, I built a tool to conduct comprehensive evaluations of RAG system using information retrieval, reference based and reference-free metric, providing a detailed assessment of both retrieval and generation components. These evaluations offered a holistic view of the system performance, identifying bottlenecks and inefficiencies that could be optimized for improved enterprise applications.
- Implemented a real-time monitoring tool using LangSmith, ensuring optimal RAG system performance by addressing issues like latency, response accuracy and tracing response.
